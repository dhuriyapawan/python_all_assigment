# Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?
#Ans
# #Python string is the collection of the characters surrounded by single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes.
# e.g str="Hi Python!"

# Q27. How can we access the string using its index?
# ans
# The index() method finds the first occurrence of the specified value.\
# string.index(value, start, end)
# txt = "Hello, welcome to my world."
# x=txt.index("t")
# print(x)

# Q28. Write a code to get the desired output of the following
# ```

      #string = "Big Data iNeuron"
      #print(string[9:])
# desired_output = "iNeuron"


# Q29. Write a code to get the desired output of the following
# # ans`

# ```
# 'iNeuron's Big Data Course'
# string=" \"iNeuron's\" Big Data Course"
# print(string)

# Q34. What is a list in Python?
# Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# e.g thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# print(thislist)

# Q35. How can you create a list in Python?
# list can be created in [] square bracket, mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Q36. How can we access the elements in a list?
# we can access list by chosing from list [0,1,2] according to what output we are wanted
# mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# print(mylist[0])

# Q37. Write a code to access the word "iNeuron" from the given list.
# ```

# print(lst[4][2])

# Q38. Take a list as an input from the user and find the length of the list.
# n=input("Enter the list ").split()
# print(len(n))

# ```
# lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
# lst.insert(2,"Big")
# print(lst)

# Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, 
# and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

# Tuple  is ordered and unchangeable.

# Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?
# We have to use  round brackets () to work codes as a tuple otherwise python does not find this is a tuple or not
# tuplelist=("name",)
# print(tuplelist)
# output=('pawan', 'Dhuriya')

# Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.

# tuple are unchaged and immutable once created does not change.
# nametuple=(" ")
# nametuple.append('pawan')
# print(nametuple)

# Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
# Tuple is immutable, although you can use the + operator to concatenate several tuples. 
# s=('1','2',3)
# s_append=s+('4','5','6')
# print(s_append)

# Q44. Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it.

# count=('2','apple','address','tree','travel')
# print(len(count))

# Q45. What are sets in Python?
# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Q46. How can you create a set?
   # we can create a set by using curly bracket {}.

# Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.
# set1={"iNeuron"}
# for x in set1:
#     print(x)

# Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.
# set1={"a","p","l","e"}
# set1.add('b')
# print(set1)

# Q49. How is update() different from add()?
# add() used to add one element to set. 
# update() method used to add multiple elements to set.

# Q50. What is clear() in sets?
# Here, set.clear() clears the set by removing all the elements of the set.
# number={'1','2','4',''}
# number.clear()
# print(number)

# Q51. What is frozen set?
# The frozenset() function returns an unchangeable frozenset object (which is like a set object, only unchangeable).

# Q52. How is frozen set different from set?
# Since the elements are fixed, unlike sets you can't add or remove elements from the frozen set.

# Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
# The union() method returns a set that contains all items from the original set, and all items from the specified set(s).
# Syntax: set1.union(set2, set3, set4â€¦.)
# set1 = {2, 4, 5, 6}
# set2 = {4, 6, 7, 8}
# x=set1.union(set2)
# print(x)

# Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.
# The intersection() method returns a set that contains the similarity between two or more sets.
# A = {2, 3, 5}
# B = {1, 3, 5}
# print(A.intersection(B))
# print(B.intersection(A))

# Q55. What is dictionary in Python?
# Python dictionary is an ordered collection (starting from Python 3.7) of items.
# It stores elements in key/value pairs. Here, keys are unique identifiers that are associated with each value
# capital_city = {"Nepal": "Kathmandu", "Italy": "Rome", "England": "London"}
# print(capital_city)

# Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.
# A dictionary in data structure supports a wide variety of operations using a wide variety of methods and functions.
# The keys are always unique within a dictionary

# Q57. How can we delare a dictionary in Python?
# we can declare dictinoary in curly braces {}.Inside the curly braces you have a key-value pair. 
# Keys are separated from their associated values with colon, : .

# Q58. What will the output of the following?
# ```
# var = {}
# print(type(var))
# # ```<class 'dict'>

# Q59. How can we add an element in a dictionary?
# thisdict = {
#   "brand": "Ford",
#   "model": "Mustang",
#   "year": 1964
# }
# print(thisdict)

# Q60. Create a dictionary and access all the values in that dictionary.
# Countries = {
#     6:'Canada',
#     2:'United Kingdom',
#     1:'United States',
#     9:'Australia',
#     7:'China'
# }
# print(Countries.values())
# for value in Countries.values():
#     print(value)

# Q61. Create a nested dictionary and access all the element in the inner dictionary.
# dict={"name":{"f_name":"pawan","l_name":"d"},"age":29 ,"work":"iT" }
